# POTUS-speech-analysis

This repo contains an IPython notebook to topic model every speech made by a President of the United States. The purpose of this project is to be able to quickly identify trending issues of their time using GENSIM's LDA model.

The corpus contains a total of 962 speeches organized into directories from President Washington to President Obama. No public data currently exists for President Trump, so we included a different corpus of the speeches he made during his Presidential Campaign in 2016.

You can view our data products in the `VisualizeTopics.ipynb` and `SentimentAnalysis.ipynb` files.
